                        Do you remember the old Jerusalem? How we used to look? Narrow roads, lots of people with caps, everyone knew everyone? :)
                    </b><br />
                    That’s where we started. 56 years ago, Hanan Mark opened his store on HaHavatzelet Street.
                    You won’t find a Jerusalemite who didn’t buy something there! From notebooks to school bags, from drafting tools to office supplies.
                    And why did they come to him? Because of the quality, the professionalism, the service, and the smile.
                    Hard to believe – 56 years have passed... We opened a large logistics center, grew to 14 physical stores and an online store (with more on the way… :)),
                    expanded our business department, and added excellent products and new categories.
                    The Jerusalemites still come, along with thousands of buyers from outside the city and businesses large and small.
                    Sadly, Hanan is no longer with us, but his values guide Shlomo, Yaakov,
                    and our 70 employees every single day – to do everything we can to be the best we can be.
                    The best in quality, the best in service, the most reliable, and the best with you – our customers and partners.<br />
                    <b>We look forward to seeing you! Yours – Shlomo, Yaakov, and the entire Hanan family.</b>
